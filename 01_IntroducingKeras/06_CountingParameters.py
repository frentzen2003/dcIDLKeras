Counting parameters
You've just created a neural network. But you're going to create a new one now, taking some time to think about the weights of each layer. The Keras Dense layer and the Sequential model are already loaded for you to use.

This is the network you will be creating:

Instantiate a new Sequential() model.
Add a Dense() layer with five neurons and three neurons as input.
Add a final dense layer with one neuron and no activation.
