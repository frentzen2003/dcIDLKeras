Exploring dollar bills
You will practice building classification models in Keras with the Banknote Authentication dataset.

Your goal is to distinguish between real and fake dollar bills. In order to do this, the dataset comes with 4 features: variance,skewness,kurtosis and entropy. These features are calculated by applying mathematical operations over the dollar bill images. The labels are found in the dataframe's class column.


A pandas DataFrame named banknotes is ready to use, let's do some data exploration!

Import seaborn as sns.
Use seaborn's pairplot() on banknotes and set hue to be the name of the column containing the labels.
Generate descriptive statistics for the banknotes authentication data.
Count the number of observations per label with .value_counts().
